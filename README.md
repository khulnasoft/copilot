# copilot

This repository extracts the Copilot language server from [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) and packages it into a tarball.

To publish a new release of the Copilot language server, create a new git tag e.g. `v1.2.3` and push it. A draft release will be created automatically. Once you publish it, KhulnaSoft users will download the updated server the first time they use Copilot.
